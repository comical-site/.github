# Welcome to the comical.site GitHub Organisation!

I will be posting source code to my projects here *3 months* after their initial launch.

## QnA
### Why 3 months?
Projects for comical.fun tend to be rushed to get them out in time, and because of that, code quality will suffer. 3 months ensures me I have enough time to finish up the code to an acceptable level before blasting it openly as "being a product of mine". Sorry!

### Can I collaborate?
No. comical.fun is a project, where I primarily code. I will seek collaboraters. I appreciate the involvement though!

One exception: If the source code has been pushed already and is available, you *can* create pull-requests.
